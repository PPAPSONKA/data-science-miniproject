# Data Science Mini Project

## Introduction

This project is a mini project for the Data Science course at the HTL Wiener Neustadt. The goal is to analyze a dataset and to create a model that can predict the target variable.

## Data

The dataset is about [Laufende Gesundheitsausgaben (HC x HF)](https://data.statistik.gv.at/web/meta.jsp?dataset=OGD_gesausgaben01_HVD_HCHF_1) which means current health expenditure.

## Tasks

#### Data

- Link to the dataset or sentences

- Download the necessary files, describe the attributes in the notebook

- Initial standard analysis with sample, head, info, describe (and unique values where appropriate!)

- Data cleaning

- wrong values

- missing values

- justified feature reduction or type setting

- Save the result data - merged and integrated from different files if necessary - in korr.csv

#### Data preparation - see attached PDF as an example

- numerical values

- Save these in num.csv

- normalized values

- Save these in norm.csv

- nominal values

- Save these in nom.csv

#### Visualization with Seaborn

- Prepare your dataset with various suitable diagrams (from all 4 datasets possible) including at least

- own color palette

- Correlations with Matplotlib.pyplot.matshow() and seaborn.heatmap()

- Pairplot

- Box vs Violinplot including subplots

- Histograms/KDE

- Scatterplots

- Line/bar charts

- Discuss each diagram - peculiarities?

## Conclusion

In the end, we should create something with the data and play around with it.
